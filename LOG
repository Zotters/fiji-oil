Was not pleased with the optimization of the script and actually ended up breaking it and felt as if I should do a complete overhaul on how it functions. Starting from the ground up and making 1.0 something to live 
for a little bit with minor updates. As I have other scripts in the works as well. So....
-------------------
V0.0.1 - A Complete Overhaul for 1.0
    - Opening a valve has been removed. We will now use oil fields. Enter an oil field and with your third eye start collecting.
      - Custom UI > Progress Bar, Notification
      - Crude oil types = Light and Heavy - Quality is random > Items now feature metadata.
      - Items are now handled within the script using ox_inventory exports (images and metadata)
      - The longer the crude sits in the players inventory the more sludge builds up (only while player is active) 
        - This should be encouraging to players to refine their oils and not just power farm crude
------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.0.2 - Collection/Refining/Framework Support
   * Collection - Custom progress bar and notification UI.
      - Valve opening has currently been removed.
      - Oil is now collected from Oil Fields 
         - Crude Oil is handled under two (2) types - Heavy & Light Crude Oil
            - Oil Types now generate metadata when collected from oil fields
               - Quality: Random generated quality between a set parameter (Config.Lua) each oil field can vary the quality. Random skill roll to add to quality.
               - Viscosity: Random generated viscosity.
               - Decay: The longer the oil sits in players inventory the more sludge builds up
   * Refining
      - 4 Phase Refining: Full interactive UI for each phase.
         - Hopper Load
         - Distill
         - Purify
         - Extraction
 * Framework
      - OX & QB Inventory Logic
(Still lots to do before 1.0, perhaps a '0.7' release to test the next function and framework support before releasing 1.0. Refining still has to be implemented. Collection is about 90% done just need to update logic
for multiframework.)
