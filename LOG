Was not pleased with the optimization of the script and actually ended up breaking it and felt as if I should do a complete overhaul on how it functions. Starting from the ground up and making 1.0 something to live 
for a little bit with minor updates. As I have other scripts in the works as well. So....
-------------------
V0.0.1 - A Complete Overhaul for 1.0
    - Opening a valve has been removed. We will now use oil fields. Enter an oil field and with your third eye start collecting.
      - Custom UI > Progress Bar, Notification
      - Crude oil types = Light and Heavy - Quality is random > Items now feature metadata.
      - Items are now handled within the script using ox_inventory exports (images and metadata)
      - The longer the crude sits in the players inventory the more sludge builds up (only while player is active) 
        - This should be encouraging to players to refine their oils and not just power farm crude
