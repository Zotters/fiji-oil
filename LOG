LOG RESET - 8/29/2025
-----------------------------------------------
To-Do: Item Images

Planned( V1.5 ):
   Quality
      * An in house quality system will be presented as many supported inventory scripts do not support metadata.
   Contracts/Reputation System
      * This will redefine the delivery system. Instead of the a simple A-B system players will obtain a tablet to accept contracts for deliveries. Upon failing or completing a contract the players reputation 
         will be updated accordingly. The reputaion system will affect various aspects of the contract system. (Pay out, contract times, etc..)
   Refinery 2.0
      * Refining Panel to be removed and added to the tablet. Refining statuses such as hopper count, distillation and collection will be handled in the tablet.
         - Distillation will now feature a minigame -- Thermal Balance

-- More to come..
