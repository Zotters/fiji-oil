Was not pleased with the optimization of the script and actually ended up breaking it and felt as if I should do a complete overhaul on how it functions. Starting from the ground up and making 1.0 something to live 
for a little bit with minor updates. As I have other scripts in the works as well. So....
-------------------
V0.0.1 - A Complete Overhaul for 1.0
    - Opening a valve has been removed. We will now use oil fields. Enter an oil field and with your third eye start collecting.
      - Custom UI > Progress Bar, Notification
      - Crude oil types = Light and Heavy - Quality is random > Items now feature metadata.
      - Items are now handled within the script using ox_inventory exports (images and metadata)
      - The longer the crude sits in the players inventory the more sludge builds up (only while player is active) 
        - This should be encouraging to players to refine their oils and not just power farm crude
------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.0.2 - Redacted.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.0.3 - Reliability/Framework/Standalone
This script will now feature its own library for notifications, progress bars, etc and zones. Removing the need for OxLib. Please be patient as this will take awhile to implement and get everything that is currently
in the script functional.

* UI - Progress / Notifications = Functional
* Zones = Functional
* Valve - Restored. Player opens valve > random generated oil field (notified with the oil field name and blip on map) > player uses empty_oil (Empty Oil Bucket) to collect oil from zone.

V0.0.4 - Refinery
Began Refinery Panel Rework.
