LOG RESET - Aug 24, 2025

- I have waited long enough troubleshooting the library. The oil script will still utilize ox-lib however will feature multi inventory support and will be a complete script.
   Eventually I will implement the library. I am ready to release 1.0 just as much as anyone else but without a fully functional library I do not want to implement it in my scripts.
   Please be patient as I round out Fiji-Oil to V1.0 with Multi-inventory support, optimized collection, refining, packaging and deliver missions.


-- OxLib is required. Progress Bars, Context Menus, Input Menus. 



- Collection
   - Valve - Same operation as before. Open the valve and a random collection zone is selected.
      - Valve Timer is now in minutes and changes to seconds.
      - Upon opening the valve a gps waypoint is already selected on the players map
- Refine
   - Automated hopper loading, distilling, extraction 
   - Allow cancelling of each phase
   - Better tracking of each phase
   - Byproducts added upon extraction
- [NEW] Packaging
   - Use your refined oil buckets and empty drums to create packaged oil drums for deliveries
- [NEW] Deliveries
