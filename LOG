- Released refining update

V0.0.1 - Packaging
Basic packaging system created
    - Uses an average system to determine the outcome of the drum
        * This a simplicist calculation and to allow 'less' inventory managment. However players managing their inventories will recieve a beter drum. Such 5x Light (Pure) Refined will equal a Light (Pure) oil drum.
          This is a better reward system for players actually involved in the oil process other then trying to make a quick dollar. This also allows the players to mix 'left-over' oils and receive a drum. I believe
          this is our best current solution for packaging. However expect modifications and improvements in the future. 
      EXAMPLE (BREAKDOWN):   
          Quality |	Item Name Prefix	| Score
          Pure	| refined_[light/heavy]_pure |	3
          Standard |	refined_[light/heavy]_standard |	2
          Dirty	| refined_[light/heavy]_dirty	| 1


              Mixture (5 units)	| Score | Total	Average |	Drum Produced
              5x  refined_light_pure | 15 |	3.0	| drum_light_pure
              3x pure, 2x standard |	13 |	2.6 |	drum_light_standard
              2x standard, 3x dirty	| 8 | 1.6 |	drum_light_dirty
              1x pure, 2x standard, 2x dirty|	9	| 1.8 |	drum_light_standard
              5x refined_heavy_dirty | 5 | 1.0	| drum_heavy_dirty
Packaging UI - Began packaging ui for players to add which oil they want to package. Instead of the server grabbing items directly from the inventory this will allow players to make mixtures and all one oil type.
   - Allows mixing of oils into the drum, uses above logic to determine the quality of the barrel.
    - Checks for empty_drum
    - Added 'Fill' button -- Automatically selects oil in the inventory to use
    - Selectable oil type by clicking to add
    - Drum fill time handled in Config.lua
    - Clear button + Cancel button
    - Panel shows the estimated quality
    - Removes items from the inventory and adds new item corresponding to the mix

V0.0.2 - Deliveries
  - Mission style deliveries
  - Min payouts and Max payouts; payouts are random per oil drum type
  - Delivery Console; Select drums which you want to deliver; Generates randoms routes from Config.DeliveryRoutes
V0.0.3 - 
    - Honestly might rewrite the whole script.
