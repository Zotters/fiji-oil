LOG RESET - Aug 24, 2025

- I have waited long enough troubleshooting the library. The oil script will still utilize ox-lib however will feature multi inventory support and will be a complete script.
   Eventually I will implement the library. I am ready to release 1.0 just as much as anyone else but without a fully functional library I do not want to implement it in my scripts.
   Please be patient as I round out Fiji-Oil to V1.0 with Multi-inventory support, optimized collection, refining, packaging and deliver missions.
