Currently in the process of redesigning the whole script to remove ox lib. The script will now feature fiji lib and multi inventory support. This is not a quick process so please be patient.
I want to release a optimized script with performance, security and simplicity in mind. With that being said the next release of the oil script will be version 1.0. 

Version 1.0
 * Oil Collection
 * 4 Phase Refining System
 * Delivery Missions 

Thank you for patience.
